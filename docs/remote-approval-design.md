# Soulguard Remote Approval Daemon — Design Notes

## Problem

Protected file changes require `sudo soulguard apply`, which means the human must be at the machine. If the agent is running unattended (e.g. on a Mac Mini), proposals sit waiting until the human returns.

Different teams also use different communication tools — Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, web dashboards — so the approval transport should be pluggable rather than hardcoded to a single platform.

## Solution

A channel-agnostic remote approval daemon that lives in `@soulguard/core`. The daemon watches `.soulguard-staging/` for changes, manages proposal lifecycle, and delegates the actual notification + approval transport to an `ApprovalChannel` plugin. Discord is the first channel implementation, packaged as `@soulguard/discord`.

## Architecture

```
Agent process (uid=agent_a)
│
│  soulguard stage SOUL.md
│  echo "..." > .soulguard-staging/SOUL.md
│

Daemon process (uid=soulguardian_agent_a)        [@soulguard/core daemon]
│
│  Watcher ─── polls .soulguard-staging/ for changes
│  Proposal Manager ─── state machine, consumes diff() + apply()
│     │
│     ├── ApprovalChannel.postProposal(diff, hash)
│     ├── ApprovalChannel.waitForApproval(id)
│     │      ← human approves via channel
│     ├── apply(tree, hash)
│     └── ApprovalChannel.postResult(id, "applied")
│
└── ApprovalChannel interface (pluggable)
     ├── DiscordChannel    (@soulguard/discord)
     └── ...
```

### Key design decisions

- **Runs as soulguardian\_\<agent\>** — the daemon doesn't need sudo, it already has write access to protected files as the guardian user
- **Systemd/launchd service** — `soulguard init` installs a systemd unit (Linux) or launchd plist (macOS) per agent
- **Filesystem polling** — watches `.soulguard-staging/` for changes, no IPC needed between agent and daemon
- **Channel-agnostic core** — all polling and lifecycle logic lives in `@soulguard/core`. Channel plugins only handle transport.

### Core daemon

The daemon has two components:

**Watcher** — Polls `.soulguard-staging/` at a fixed interval. When a change is detected (new, modified, or removed staging entries), it waits for a configurable debounce period (default 3s) after the last write before creating a proposal. This handles the common case where agents stage multiple files in rapid succession.

The agent can opt into **batch mode** by writing a `.soulguard-staging/.wait-for-ready` sentinel. While this file exists, the daemon suppresses proposal creation regardless of debounce. The agent removes the sentinel (or writes `.soulguard-staging/.ready`) to signal the batch is complete and trigger a proposal. A safety timeout (default 5 minutes) prevents a crashed agent from blocking proposals indefinitely — if the sentinel isn't removed within the timeout, the daemon logs a warning and proposes the current staging state anyway.

**Proposal Manager** — State machine for proposal lifecycle:

```
              ┌─── approved   ──→ apply(tree, hash) ──→ postResult("applied")
              │
pending ──────┤─── rejected   ──→ postResult("rejected")
              │
              └─── superseded ──→ postResult("superseded")
```

- Builds a `StateTree` snapshot + computes diff and approval hash at proposal creation time
- On approval: calls `apply()` with the snapshotted tree and hash
- Only one proposal is active at a time. New staging changes while a proposal is pending supersede it (cancel old, create new) — this is the natural staleness mechanism, no wall-clock timeout needed.

### ApprovalChannel interface

```typescript
interface ApprovalChannel {
  postProposal(proposal: { diff: string; hash: string; description?: string }): Promise<string>; // returns channel-specific proposal ID

  waitForApproval(proposalId: string): Promise<{
    approved: boolean;
    approver: string;
  }>;

  postResult(proposalId: string, result: "applied" | "rejected" | "superseded"): Promise<boolean>;

  dispose(): Promise<void>;
}
```

- **`postProposal`** — The channel posts the diff to its platform and returns a channel-specific ID (e.g., Discord message ID, Slack message timestamp). The daemon tracks this.
- **`waitForApproval`** — Long-lived. Can block (polling) or use events (websocket/webhook). The interface is agnostic to the mechanism.
- **`postResult`** — Best-effort confirmation (returns `boolean` for logging). If posting fails, the apply/reject has already happened.
- **`dispose`** — Cleanup: close connections, stop listeners.

### Agent-provided description

The agent can write a description to `.soulguard-staging/.description`. The daemon reads this and passes it as `description` in the `postProposal` call. How it's displayed is up to the channel implementation. This is purely informational — the hash is what matters for security.

## Config

All daemon and channel config lives in `soulguard.json` under a `"daemon"` key, matching the existing convention of a single config file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "guardian": "soulguardian_myagent",
  "files": {
    "soulguard.json": "protect",
    "SOUL.md": "protect",
    "MEMORY.md": "watch"
  },
  "git": true,
  "daemon": {
    "channel": "discord",
    "debounceMs": 3000,
    "batchReadyTimeoutMs": 300000,
    "discord": {
      "botToken": "...",
      "channelId": "123456789",
      "approverUserIds": ["111111111", "222222222"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **`daemon.channel`** — Which `ApprovalChannel` implementation to use
- **`daemon.debounceMs`** — Wait this long after the last staging write before creating a proposal
- **`daemon.batchReadyTimeoutMs`** — Maximum time to wait for a `.wait-for-ready` sentinel to be removed before proposing anyway (default 300000 / 5 minutes)
- **`daemon.<channel>`** — Channel-specific config block. Core validates daemon-level fields and passes through the channel block without interpretation.

`soulguard.json` is always protected — the agent can't tamper with daemon or channel config.

## Discord channel

`@soulguard/discord` is the first `ApprovalChannel` implementation, using Discord.js.

### How it implements the interface

- **`postProposal`** — Sends an embed to the configured channel with the diff summary, hash, and optional description. Returns the Discord message ID.
- **`waitForApproval`** — Listens for emoji reactions (✅ / ❌) on the proposal message from approved user IDs.
- **`postResult`** — Edits the original message or posts a follow-up with the outcome.
- **`dispose`** — Disconnects the Discord client.

### Security model

#### Trust anchor

The human's Discord user ID. Discord's auth model guarantees a bot token can only act _as the bot_, never _as a human user_. The agent cannot forge a reaction from an approved human.

#### Primary defense: content verification at approval time

When the human reacts to approve, the channel implementation re-derives the canonical diff from the current staging state tree and verifies it matches the message content exactly (both diff text and hash). If they don't match — whether due to editing, message replacement, or state drift — the approval is rejected.

This single invariant covers multiple attack vectors: message editing, fake message posting, and staging changes between proposal and approval. The hash ensures the staging tree hasn't been modified; the content check ensures the human saw an accurate representation of what will be applied.

#### Defense in depth: edit detection

As an early warning, the channel checks `edited_timestamp != null` on the proposal message. If edited, the proposal is immediately invalidated with a visible warning ("⚠️ This proposal was modified externally and has been invalidated") — catching tampering _before_ the human reacts, which is better UX than a silent rejection after approval.

#### Reconnect behavior

If the channel connection drops and reconnects, the daemon locates its existing proposal message (by tracked message ID) and verifies the content still matches the current state tree. If it matches, it resumes waiting for approval. If the message is missing or content doesn't match, it supersedes and posts a fresh proposal.

#### Threat: agent deletes message and posts a lookalike

**Defense:** The channel implementation tracks its own message ID. Only accepts reactions on that specific message. Additionally, content verification at approval time ensures any replacement message would need to contain the exact canonical diff — which the agent cannot forge without knowing the correct staging state (which it does know, but cannot produce a diff that misrepresents the contents while matching the hash).

#### Threat: agent reacts with ✅ itself

**Defense:** Filter reactions by user ID. Only `approverUserIds` are accepted. The bot's own user ID is always excluded.

#### Threat: agent spams staging to fatigue the human

**Mitigations:**

- Only the most recent proposal is active (daemon-level — new staging changes supersede the old proposal)
- Discord-specific: could require the bot to be the sole poster in a dedicated channel

#### Hash provides defense in depth

Even if all UX-level checks were bypassed, the `--hash` flag on `soulguard apply` ensures the staging tree hasn't been modified between review and apply. The hash is a SHA-256 over the actual staged file contents. This is an `apply()` guarantee from `@soulguard/core`, not Discord-specific — but worth restating here.

## Per-agent guardian

**Status: implemented**

The daemon requires per-agent soulguardian users (`soulguardian_agent_a`, `soulguardian_agent_b`) so that:

- Each daemon process can only access its own workspace's protected files
- Each daemon has its own channel config in `soulguard.json`
- OS permissions enforce the boundary between agents

The group `soulguard` stays shared (only used for read access).

## Adding future channels

To add a new approval channel (e.g., Slack):

1. Create a new package (e.g., `@soulguard/slack`)
2. Implement the `ApprovalChannel` interface
3. Define the channel-specific config shape (validated by the channel, not core)
4. Document channel-specific security considerations — each transport has its own threat model
5. Users set `"channel": "slack"` in their `soulguard.json` daemon config and add the `"slack": { ... }` block

For example, a Slack implementation might use thread-based approval (proposal posted as a message, approve/reject via thread reply or emoji), with trust anchored to Slack workspace membership + user IDs.

## Decisions

- **Multiple simultaneous channels** — Not in initial scope. Fine to add later, but not a pressing concern.
- **Fallback when remote channel is unreachable** — The fallback is the existing `sudo soulguard apply` CLI workflow. The daemon is additive, not a replacement.
- **Multi-party approval (N of M)** — Not in initial scope.
- **Channel plugin discovery** — Convention-based dynamic import. The daemon resolves `"channel": "discord"` to `@soulguard/discord` via dynamic `import()`. The imported module must export a `createChannel(config)` function that returns an `ApprovalChannel`. If the package isn't installed, the daemon fails with a helpful message ("install @soulguard/discord to use the discord channel"). The `soulguard` meta-package bundles Discord as a default dependency so it works out of the box.

## Open questions

- **Secret management for bot tokens** — Currently stored as plaintext in `soulguard.json` (which is protected). Future consideration: support env var references or OS keychain integration for channel secrets.
